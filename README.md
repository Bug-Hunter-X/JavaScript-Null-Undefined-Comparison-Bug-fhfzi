This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in JavaScript related to the comparison of null and undefined values.

The `bug.js` file contains the buggy code, which incorrectly handles cases where the input `x` is either null or undefined. The incorrect behavior arises from the loose equality check (`==`) in the if statement.  This check does not always distinguish between null and undefined, which might lead to unexpected behavior or errors. 

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version that addresses the bug using strict equality (`===`) and handling each case (null and undefined) explicitly.

This example highlights the importance of using strict equality in JavaScript when comparing values, especially when dealing with null and undefined.
